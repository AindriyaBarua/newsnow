# NewsNow
NewsNow is a simple application that does the extraordinary. Have you ever read multiple reports of the same piece of news because you feel that something may be missing? Now, that might actually be true owing to factors such as missing facts or selective journalism.
Well, NewsNow solves that problem for you.

NewsNow is an application that takes in a search query and provides you with a crisp and error free readable verion of the news article from over 5 different reputed sources. It merges documents together by mimicing a human mind while also making sure to remove any kind of duplicate entries so that you don't spend more than 5-8mins reading the article.


NewsNow was a project built as a part of our Introduction to Computing using Python course (UE18CS101) at PES University. The project is complete and is a fully working and deployable product.
